<h1 id=3D"SoftwareEngineers-Overview">Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Levels</strong>: Every software engineer employee has a level, w=
hich describes the scope, complexity, and impact of their role and factors =
into compensation. When a new developer joins theLotter, we evaluate his ab=
ilities and try to classify him based on the interview process and his expe=
rience. We understand this may not reflect the actual capabilities, so on h=
is first months we will evaluate him and adapt as needed.</p>
<p>Each level builds on the criteria from the preceding level. So for examp=
le, an L4 must also meet all the criteria for an L3.</p>
<p>The levels described here are a&nbsp;<strong>subjective</strong>&nbsp;(i=
nternal to theLotter) classification to theLotter and intentionally do not =
reflect market concepts such as Junior developer, mid developer or Senior d=
eveloper.</p>
<p><strong>Years of experience:&nbsp;</strong> has a contribution to the cl=
assification, but do not guaranty a correlation. You may be very experience=
 developer, with 7 years experience which will be L3, BUT you can also be 3=
 years developer which is L3. </p>
<p>We do not have strict minimum requirements for years of experience at an=
y given level. We evaluate scope of responsibility and impact, and we never=
 want to fail to recognize high performance due to a test like years of exp=
erience.</p>
<p>The rules that guide us are impact and value. <br><em>"are you able to p=
erform the level responsibilities"?!?</em></p>
<p><strong>Two Tracks</strong>: Engineers and Engineering Managers are on t=
wo distinct career tracks. This ensures that an engineer can grow in their =
career and take on more responsibility without having to become a manager. =
While there are some overlapping responsibilities between the roles, the sk=
ills and motivations necessary to be effective vary. We want engineers to c=
onsider becoming managers if they are interested in the core responsibiliti=
es of people management; if they aren=E2=80=99t, we provide a path to take =
on larger scope and demonstrate leadership as an individual contributor. Th=
is helps ensure we don=E2=80=99t create an incentive to change roles for th=
e wrong reasons. Engineers and managers at the same level will have compara=
ble scope and impact on the business.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming a manager is not a promotion</strong>: As discussed in =
more detail below, we define a promotion as moving up a level. When an engi=
neer first becomes a manager, they remain in the same level and move latera=
lly to the engineering management track. Again, we don=E2=80=99t want to in=
centivize becoming a manager solely for career advancement.</p>
