# Overview

This repo is trying to assist R&D organizations with building a career path for their software, product, QA engineers (I refer to all as engineers :). 

One of my responsibility as a (CTO) leader is to provide a clear feedback and expectation to the teams. Another responsibility is to provide a transparent career path and assist the teams to grow.

Ladders assist in both. 
We use the ladders during our 360 reviews (you might know it as performance review) and 1 on 1s.

The ladders describes an expected behaviors from the teams, as they grow. They do not list all the different behaviors and they might vary between some roles, yet it provides a guidance.

As leaders, we want each of the engineers to grow and when one does, it is a cause for celerbration :) 

# Growth Factors
We are looking into 4 different areas of growth:

### Exection
How well is the engineer executes his tasks. As the engineer grows, it is expected that the execution level will increase. Handle issues faster, move with ease, monitor his work, etc. 

### Technology Proficiency
How does the engineer progress with technology skills and knowledge.

### Impact of Team, Impact on R&D, Impact on Organization

What impact does the engineer has on the team, R&D and the organization. As the engineer grows, it is expected to see an increasing impact.  
Some examples: review PRs, Mentoring, Assisting solving escalation, knowledge sharing etc.

### Culture 
Does the engineer share same culture attributes and values with us.
